# ETL-Mini-Project

For the ETL mini project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and both Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
